        <p>JavaScript is the most common language for making webpages interactive</p>
        This list of best practices uses code samples and side-by-side examples to help you write more readable, efficient code.s

      <h3>Make it Understandable</h3>
        <div class="more-stuff-grid">
         
          <img
            src="./assets/image1.PNG"
            alt=""
            class="slide-in from-left"
          />
          <p class="slide-in from-right">
            Choose easy to understand and short names for variables and functions.
            Your code is a story - make your storyline easy to follow!
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Avoid Globals</h3>
        <div class="more-stuff-grid">
          <p class="slide-in from-left">
            Global variables are a terribly bad idea.<br>
            <strong>Reason:</strong> You run the danger of your code being overwritten by any other JavaScript added to the page after yours.<br>
            <strong>Workaround:</strong> use closures and the module pattern
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/image2.PNG"
            alt=""
            class="slide-in from-right"
          />
        </div>
        <h3> Use Shortcut Notations</h3>
        <div class="more-stuff-grid">
          <img
          src="./assets/image3.PNG"
            alt=""
            class="slide-in from-right"
          />
          <p class="slide-in from-left">
            Shortcut notations keep your code snappy and easier to read once you get used to it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Allow for Configuration and Translation</h3>
        <div class="more-stuff-grid">
          <p class="slide-in from-left">
            Everything that is likely to change in your code should not be scattered throughout your code.
            This includes labels, CSS classes, IDs and presets.
            By putting these into a configuration object and making this one public we make maintenance easy and allow for customization.
